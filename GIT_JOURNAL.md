# Git Journal

I learned the full PR workflow, from creating a feature branch (`git checkout -b`) to automatically closing issues (`Closes #1`). I fixed mistakes where I forgot to `git add` a file and later forgot to push my tags (`git push --tags`). The GitHub web UI for resolving merge conflicts saved the day.
