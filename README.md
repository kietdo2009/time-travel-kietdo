Reasons for .gitignore files
This repo ignores '.DS\_Store' and 'Thumbs.db files, which are system-specific files created by macOS and Windows, respectively. They are essentially cache so not needed.


## Branching Strategy
- **author/idea-sprint**: This branch is used by the Author for brainstorming and creating new zine content.
- **editor/review**: This branch is used by the Editor to review, approve, and merge content before it goes to main.
